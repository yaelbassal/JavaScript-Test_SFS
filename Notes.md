# Next Steps

- Remove checked rows if a row is checked off and Remove Debt Button is clicked.
- Calculate total balance for only checked rows
- Styling: new added rows <input> tag hide border
- Code consistency - currently using a mix of vanilla js and jquery

# Challenges
- Calculating table totals that coorelate to if a checkbox is checked, for example total balance. More research into how to access individual cell values when using document methods like getElementById().
- Removing a row if its checkbox is checked. More research into how to identify the parent element and remove the row from the DOM.
- Thinking through the best ways to approach this assignment - where/how to add event listeners and where to invoke functions. Best practices.
